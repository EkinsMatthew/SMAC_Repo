CHANGES IN ALPHA CENTAURI VERSION 2.0

-----------------------------------------------

The v2.0 Update to Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri includes several new features to enhance the Alpha Centauri gameplay experience as well as a host of small fixes. Most notably, v2.0 includes Hotseat and Play-by-email multiplayer modes.  A complete list of v2.0 changes is included below.

ADDITIONS
*       HOTSEAT multiplayer mode is now available! 
*       Play-by-email multiplayer mode is now available!
*	To start a hotseat game, select Multiplayer from the main menu and then Hotseat/PBEM. After setting up Planet, select a faction for each of the human players. Each player has an opportunity to select a password on their first turn to provide a level of privacy. Leave the field blank to bypass this feature. When a player ends their turn, a prompt will appear for the next player. If playing Hotseat, the next player should take over here. If playing PBEM, select Save and Exit. The game automatically exits, at which point you should email the resulting save game to the next player (as indicated on the last on-screen prompt). Most features of the game are identical to non-simultaneous multiplayer games. A notable difference however is Diplomacy, which can now takes place over several turns. After contacting another player, make your selections and hit End Transmission. When the other player's turn begins, the diplomacy window will appear with your proposal. Negotiations can take place over any number of turns.
*       You can now see the destination of a unit without selecting it. This option can be toggled under "Map" preferences.
*       You can now disable probe team "steal technology in the RULES section of ALPHA.TXT.
*       You can now release mind worms into wild using the "Turn Over Unit Control" option on the Action Menu.
*       You can now customize the map size when generating a random planet.
*       Probe teams are now "unflagged", meaning you cannot easily tell who controls the team.
*       Atrocities have been rebalanced to avoid abuse: (a) 12+ atrocities (depends on difficulty level) will cause all factions to declare vendetta (b) Nerve stapling becomes increasingly ineffective at particular bases the more you use it.
*       The Hive now has the "Immunity, EFFIC" ability; Hive never receives negative EFFICIENCY penalties.
*	Password security for multiplayer games. 
*	Hardware 3D positional and EAX support added - Note: this can be disabled in alpha centauri.ini by entering  ds3d=0 or eax=0. This also provides overall better performance and memory usage.

ENHANCEMENTS
*       You can now set waypoints for patrols using the spacebar. Press "p" key as usual to start patrol, then click-and-drag mouse to first waypoint; while still holding mouse button, press SPACE to set waypoint; you can then drag line to next point, etc. When you reach final destination, release mouse button.
*       Datalinks now show cost/preq of Abilities and Terraforming
*       Combat report text is now larger in 1024x768 resolution
*       "People" icons are now smaller for cursor in base screen "drag and drop"
*       Design Workshop: dark blue letters on dark background are now more legible
*       You can no longer name/rename landmarks near other people's territory.
*       Pact Brothers no longer offer map in tech trade (already gives map for free)
*       The world map now updates as new areas are explored, as opposed to waiting until the end of a turn.

*       Air Units are no longer influenced by travel rate of fungus and so forth.
*       Dragging air unit move: distance is now shown correctly
*       F4 screen "turns to go" now accounts for prototype cost
*       Clicking "end of turn" when a unit is active (but has already moved) no longer says, "all units have moved".
*       New unit changes are now correctly displayed when you go to Change Unit, then from there to unit design (where you Obsolete/Design/whatever) and then come back the change menu again.
*       When "continue with current/change to new/add to beginning of queue" warning is displayed after changing build command and if you pick "add to queue" it now adds the selected unit correctly (instead of always adding a Colony Pod).
*       Typo corrected when you hit the "Reset" button in Social Engineering

SINGLE PLAYER

IMPROVING PERFORMANCE

If you are experiencing performance problems, try some of the following tips:

*  Included in the Alternative Art folder on the CD-ROM is a Low Res Caviar folder. Copy the contents of this folder to the directory you installed the game to. The default is c:\program files\firaxis games\sid meier's alpha centauri. These files reduce the detail in the units, but can improve performance.
*  Reduce your resolution to 800 x 600, rather than 1024 x 768. This can greatly improve all game performance.
*  Disable the sound using the Audio/Visual Preferences menu.
*  Disable map animations, sliding windows, and sliding scrollbars.
*  Enable the following preferences: Move Friendly Pieces Quickly, Fast Battle Resolution, Move Units with orders quickly, Don't Center On Units With Orders
*  Increase the amount of free hard drive space on the C: drive.
*  Increase the amount of RAM in your system.

NEW FEATURES

* Right click on a Pact Brother from commlink menu to end a pact.

LAPTOP INSTALL

This install size copies the very minimum files to the hard that are required by the game to operate. It also alters the default game preferences to improve over performance.

COMPLETE INSTALL

This install copies the entire contents of the CD-Rom to the hard drive. It requires 360 megabytes of hard drive space.

GAMMA CORRECTION / "IF THE GRAPHICS SEEM TOO DARK"

We've added a Gamma Correction feature to allow the customer to adjust the brightness of the palette without adjusting their monitor. It is accessible from any of the preference menus. The default value is 1.0.

WINDOWS NT

Almost all features of SMAC should work under Windows NT 4.0. You'll need to obtain NT Service Pack 3 or higher from Microsoft and install it, which includes DirectX 3 or higher support. Note: Sound support under NT currently requires us to use emulated drivers; this can in some cases produce poor sound results, including static and sound breaking up.

CPU OVERCLOCKING

If you experience random crashes and you are overclocking your CPU (especially with AMD K-5 and K-6 processors), try returning your CPU speed to it's original setting. 

MOVIE PERFORMANCE

If your computer has problems playing some of the in-game movies, verify that you are not using any 16-bit real mode drivers for the CD-ROM drive. You can check this by opening the Control Panel and choosing the System settings. Under the Performance tab, there is a line for File System. This should read 32-bit. If it has anything else in that line, contact the manufacturer of your CD-ROM drive for updated Windows 95/98 drivers. If you still experience problems playing movies, try adding 'DirectDraw=0' to the Alpha Centauri.ini file in the install directory.

ADDITIONAL TWEAKS

Once the game is installed, a file is created called "Alpha Centauri.ini". This file contains various settings and preferences for the game, but can also be edited by the user. The following commands will allow you some control over the look of various parts of the game.

WindowsFileBox=1
Settings this to 1 allows you to use the traditional Win95/98 file navigation dialog.

MainFontSize=16
You can increase or decrease the size of the font used throughout the game. 

DirectDraw=0
Settings this to 0 disables DirectDraw. This disables the automatic window resolution resizing during program launch.

Video Mode=800 or Video Mode=1024
This forces the screen resolution to either of these two sizes.

8BitMovieSound=1
This forces the sound quality to 8-bit from the original 16-bit. If your sound card has DirectX compatibility issues, this may improve movie performance.

ForceOldVoxelAlgorithm=1
If the game crashes intermittently, try adding this line.

TROUBLESHOOTING - If your computer has problems playing the game (crashes, returning to desktop, etc.), please try the following:

1. Reinstall DirectX 6. Run the DXSetup.exe program that is available on the CD-ROM in the \DirectX folder.

2. Rename the SOUND.DLL to SOUND.DL_. While disabling the sound, it may correct your original problem.

3. If you receive the message "CPU Not Supported", and you have a non-Intel processor such as an AMD K-5, try to run the game anyway. Many AMD processors show up as a 486 in verification tests, but if your machine is 'Pentium Compatible', it shouldn't be a problem.

4. Increase amount of free hard drive space on the C: drive, especially if you have 16 or 32 megs of memory. 

5. Let Windows handle your swap file size. This can be adjusted by running the System Control Panel, selecting the Performance menu tab, then the Virtual Memory button, and selecting "Let Windows manage my virtual memory settings".

6. Update the Windows 95/98 drivers for your Video card, Sound card, and Monitor.

MULTIPLAYER

New Features:

* Change symbol next to faction name in 'commlink' menu to 'null' (zero with a slash through it) by clicking on it to ignore all messages from a player. 

NON-SIMULTANEOUS MULTIPLAYER:

A feature we added is non-simultaneous movement in multiplayer games. Benefits of this mode include significantly less packet transmission (to improve performance), the ability to execute diplomacy without your turn clock running out, and the luxury to fine tune your bases while other players complete their moves.  Disable the Simultaneous Move option on the Multiplayer Setup screen to use this feature.  The game plays essentially the same as the simultaneous move game, except when other players are making their moves, you maintain control. Except for actually moving units, you can access any base, any report screen, initiate or participate in diplomacy, and many other actions.

VOICE OVER DATA TROUBLESHOOTING:

One of the features of Alpha Centauri is the ability to use a microphone connected to your sound card for real-time voice communication during multiplay games. Below are some troubleshooting techniques you may try if you're experiencing difficulty using this feature.

VOICE LINK TIPS:

1. Before attempting to use the voice link feature in Alpha Centauri we recommend testing the recording functionality of your sound card with the Sound Recorder the comes with Win '98 / '95.  If you can get that working then the voice link will most likely work.

2. Keep in mind this feature is designed to work using as little bandwidth as possible so quality will be marginal. However you should be able to understand the person who is talking. If not, try experimenting with microphone volume , mic placement, and speech volume. It may not be pretty but it sure beats typing messages.

3. If you're unfamiliar with the Windows record settings here is how to access them: First open up the "advanced mixer" by double clicking on the volume control icon located on the Windows task bar (looks like a speaker). If this icon is not present you need to enable it by opening the control panel, multimedia properties and checking the "show volume control on taskbar" checkbox. By having the volume control on the taskbar you can adjust the settings while you in the game.
Once the "advanced volume control" is showing - it looks like a mixer with a number of sliders - look for a microphone slider. If you don't see it pull down the options menu, look for a microphone check box and check it and hit ok. This will add a microphone slider to you playback volume control. Make sure that slider is muted, this will prevent feedback. Now pull down the options menu and select recording and hit OK. From there you can adjust your volume. Once again if you don't see the microphone slider for the record volume control pull down the options and check the microphone check box.
 
4. Many sound cards come with a mic boost feature. While in the record mixer pull down the menu and select "Advanced." Look at the mic slider.  If there's an "Advanced" button, hit it and look for a mic boost check box.  Experiment with it to get the best sound.

5. Use the voice link like a walkie-talkie. Press down and hold the '\' key, talk and when finished let it up.  Only talk in turns because the system is half-duplex (It can't transmit and receive at the same time).  Avoid using it during the upkeep phase in multiplayer since during that time it's possible to let up on the key and not stop the recording. You know it's working when the games sounds stop. If the games sounds don't return after letting up (during upkeep) then wait till upkeep is finished and press and let up on the key again - the sound should return.

KNOWN PROBLEMS:

1. During the upkeep phase in multiplayer recording may get stuck causing game sounds to stop. just press the '\' key till the sound returns.

2. General poor sound quality of voice over data.

3. We decided to leave game sounds on during voice link reception and incoming messages can sometimes get garbled with voice stuff in the game.

TROUBLESHOOTING:

1. Some users may experience problems when playing Alpha Centauri using America Online (AOL) as their connection to the internet. Please consult the web page (www.firaxis.com) for updated information concerning this issue.

2. Modem TCP/IP games with more than 2 players may degrade game performance on some networks.  We will keep updated information on TCP/IP game performance on our web page.

SCENARIOS:

There are a number of pre-generated scenarios provided with the game in the '\scenarios' directory.
 
*The first three, labeled "1Explore", "2Build", and "3Conquer", are tutorials designed to get beginners up and running with the game. *The "Faction v Faction" folder contains three scenarios pitting a faction against its archenemy; these may be played as single-player or multiplayer scenarios.
 
*The three folders beginning with "MP..." are designed as balanced multiplayer scenarios with defined goals and short time limits. Try them out for a shorter, sharp, fun multiplayer experience!

*The last scenario, "SP--7 PlayerA" puts the factions arrayed around a central continent in a struggle for territory.

Enjoy,
